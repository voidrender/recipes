# New Orleans Iced Coffee

1. Grind 225g of beans on a medium setting (I use Heart Stereo at 20 in a Baratza Encore).
2. Add 30g ground chicory and mix in a large lidded vessel.
3. Add 1100ml of water, stir.
4. Cover and let steep for 12 hours at room temperature.
5. Strain and store in an airtight vessel in the refrigerator for up to a week.

Serve over ice with an equal part whole milk and a dash of simple syrup to taste (≈5% by volume).
